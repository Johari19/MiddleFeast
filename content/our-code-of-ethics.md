### **Code of Ethics for Middle Feast**

##### **Connecting with our community**

Middle Feasts corporate responsibility is to bring our community together through their love for food, specifically Shawarma. When creating this company, it came to our realization that all individuals during this crisis need a community to support them. Middle Feast will be addressing this issue with our product. More specifically, our authentic middle eastern dish will not only unite the student body but allow bring the entire Loyola family together.

To make the Shawarma our community is craving for it is important to support local businesses during this time. As our economy enters a recession in the foreseeable future, Middle Feast believes in empowering the community by supporting our local businesses. Our company has several middle eastern bakeries, and grocery stores in mind to purchase from in the greater Montreal region.

##### **Quality Control**

It is of great importance for Middle Feast to deliver an authentic experience to our customers. That is why we will be sourcing our products from Montreal based middle eastern businesses, where we will be purchasing the highest quality products from animals that were farmed locally. Throughout many countries there is a neglect for livestock and animal health, this results in a poor product but is also a risk to our communities as seen during this crisis, this is why we value purchasing locally farmed ingredients.

##### **Employee Conduct**

Middle Feast values itself in maintaining a culture of ethics, trust, and we highly value our employees and our associates opinions. As a family, we encourage our members to advise us if they are aware of, or have a concern about, our Code of Ethics and policies.

* Every Employee must respect our family and every member of our community


* Our employees will not be reprimanded for conducting an action that will result in a loss of business if it is aligned with Middle Feasts Code of Ethics and policies.
* Raising concern of misconduct in the company with good intent is encouraged

**Any employee who reciprocates against an employee for exercising their rights to go through with these actions will be severely reprimanded and asked to leave the company.**
